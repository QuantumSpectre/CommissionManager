Project: CommissionManager

Overview

WARNING - Currently in the minimum viable product stage!

  CommissionManager is a comprehensive GUI-based WPF application designed to streamline the workflow of artists, empowering them to seamlessly manage commissions, maintain a client       database, and provide transparent information to their patrons. Currently in its early stages of development, CommissionManager aspires to become an indispensable tool for artists.

Motivation

  The genesis of CommissionManager lies in the my own personal need as an artist seeking a centralized tool to manage their art career and focus on their creative endeavors.        
  Recognizing the widespread need for such a tool among artists, the project was born with the aim of providing a comprehensive solution for artists of all levels.
